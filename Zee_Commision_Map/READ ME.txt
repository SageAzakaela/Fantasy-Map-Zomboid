RULES FOR USING THIS REPOSITORY!


1. Make sure you ask before you make a push please

2. ONLY use and save buildings from the buildings folder!  

3. If you save a building, save it in the Buildings Folder, under a new subfolder with your name for example AZA/mybuilding.tbx

4. Lets try to keep dependencies on other tilesets to a minimum, only use approved tilesets.

5. To avoid bugginess, we should each work on seperate cells at first


GETTING STARTED:

1. After you've downloaded the repository, you're gonna need to go to the CustomTiles Folder and grab all the tile files, copy them, then go to the Tilezed folder and drop them in the Tiles/2x folder! Otherwise a bunch of stuff will be red question marks

2. You'll need to point WorldEds Rules/Blends in Tiled to our custom_rules_and_blends files, otherwise everything might look fucked up hahah

3. Make sure in Tiled you go to preferences, zomboid, then add AZA.pzw to the list so you can see buildings and attached cells in the editor
